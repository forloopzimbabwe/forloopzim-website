      forloopZimbabwe is a community of software developers and tech enthusiasts
      from Zimbabwe. We meet in borrowed spaces, graciously provided by
      different companies and organisations. Our purpose is to provide a place
      where our members have a good time talking about programming, sharing
      their knowledge, meeting other passionate folks and helping each other
      grow in the field. We keep it friendly, inclusive and positive.
