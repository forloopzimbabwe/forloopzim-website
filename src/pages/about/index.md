## Sharing Ideas and Meeting Others

forloopZimbabwe is a community of software developers and tech enthusiasts from Zimbabwe. We meet in borrowed spaces, graciously provided by different companies and organisations. Our purpose is to provide a place where our members have a good time talking about programming, sharing their knowledge, meeting other passionate folks and helping each other grow in the field. We keep it friendly, inclusive and positive.
