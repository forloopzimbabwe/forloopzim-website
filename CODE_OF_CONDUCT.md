# forloopZimbabwe Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at forloopZimbabwe are required to follow this code of conduct. Organisers will enforce it throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

In case you need help or assistance, don't hesitate to approach our crew (wearing branded T-shirts) or send an email to [forloopzw@gmail.com](mailto:forloopzw@gmail.com).

## The Short Version
Our events are dedicated to providing harassment-free experiences for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organisers.

## The Long Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges. 

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance. 

We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop venues and event-related social events.
